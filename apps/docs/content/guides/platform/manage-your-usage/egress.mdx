## What you are charged for
You are charged for the network data transmitted out of the system to a connected client. Egress is incurred by all services - Database, Authentication, Storage, Edge Functions, Realtime, and Log Drains.

## How charges are calculated
Egress is charged by byte. Charges apply only for usage exceeding the subscription plan's free quota. This quota can be used across all services (Database, Authentication, Storage etc.), also referred to as Unified Egress.

### Egress usage on your invoice
Egress usage is shown as "Egress GB" on your invoice.

## Pricing
1 GB is $0.09 per month. You are only charged for usage exceeding your subscription plan's free quota.

## Billing examples
### Within quota
The organization's Egress usage is within the free quota, so no charges for Egress apply.

| Line Item           | Units     | Costs   |
|---------------------|-----------|---------|
| Pro Plan            | 1         | $25     |
| Compute Hours Micro | 744 hours | $10     |
| Egress              | 200 GB    | $0      |
| **Subtotal**        |           | **$35** |

### Exceeding quota
The organization's Egress usage exceeds the free quota by 50 GB, incurring charges for this additional usage.

## Debug Egress usage
To better understand your Egress usage, identify whatâ€™s driving the most traffic. Check the most frequent database queries, or analyze the most requested API paths to pinpoint high-bandwidth endpoints.

### Frequent database queries
On the Advisors [Query performance view](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/database/query-performance?preset=most_frequent&sort=calls&order=desc) you can see the most frequent queries and the average number of rows returned.

  }}

/>

### Most requested API endpoints
In the [Logs Explorer](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/logs/explorer) you can access Edge Logs, and review the top paths to identify heavily queried endpoints. These logs currently do not include response byte data. That data will be available in the future too.

## Optimize Egress usage
- Reduce the number of fields or entries selected when querying your database
- Reduce the number of queries or calls by optimizing client code or using caches
- For update or insert queries, configure your ORM or queries to not return the entire row if not needed
- When running manual backups through Supavisor, remove unneeded tables and/or reduce the frequency
- Refer to the [Storage Optimizations guide](/docs/guides/storage/production/scaling#egress) for tips on reducing Storage Egress
